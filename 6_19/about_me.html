			<h1> About Me</h1>

			<h3> Strategist, partner, trusted advisor  </h3>
			<br>
			<p> I'm a marketing and communications strategist with experience in traditional and digital marketing. I studied Sociology and Africana Studies at Cornell University. After spending a few years in the working world I wanted to develop some additional skills and earned an MBA at Babson College.</p> 
			<br>
			<p> Work is but one aspect of who I am. I'm physically active and have completed a half marathon, sprint triathlon, and several 5ks. I'm currently obsessed with high intensity interval training (HIIT) and Fitbit challenges. I also have a strong sweet tooth and am the friend that is always tasked with bringing dessert to the party.
