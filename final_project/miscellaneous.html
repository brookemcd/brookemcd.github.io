			<h1> Miscellaneous</h1>

			<h3> A rich life is composed of diverse experiences </h3>
			<br>
			<p> The scope of my work to date has focused primarily on the areas of communications, marketing, and fundraising. As a result, I've worked for a variety of firms including community development, public relations, financial services, and others. Each experience has naturally afforded me the opportunity to stretch and develop different skill sets.</p> 
			<br>
			<p> I have a personal interest in personal finance, food, and wine and have had the opportunity to incorporate these passions in my professional life.</p>
