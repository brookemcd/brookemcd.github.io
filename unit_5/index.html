				<p> Welcome to my website.  I'm using this website to capture some of my most meaningful professional experiences to date. Like most humans, it's challenging to capture all that I've done in a 7 page website. So, instead, I've tried to cull my experiences down into four main areas and share some of my most proud accomplishments. Short on time? Check out <a href="">About Me</a>. </p>

				<p> I've had the good fortune of working for a variety of businesses - from nonprofits, to small-to-medium businesses, and large corporations - in various capacities. In all roles, I've partnered with my clients in service of their respective goals, primarily in the area of marketing and communication. </p>
				
				<p> Given the confidential nature of some of the work I've done, you'll need a password to access some areas of the websites. </p>
