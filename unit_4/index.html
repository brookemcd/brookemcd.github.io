	<h1> Strategy </h1>

	<h3> Helping clients deliver on the objectives they've set </h3>

	<p> A goal without a plan is like a bicycle with no wheels, without the right components you'll never get to your intended destination. </p> 
	
	<p>Over the past ten years I've partnered with a diverse book of clients to help them achieve their respective goals. By understanding their needs, leveraging data, and assessing the context in which they're working, I've developed thoughtful, results-driven strategies.  </p>

	<p> Here are a few examples of my work </p>
