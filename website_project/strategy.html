		<h1> Strategy </h1>

		<h3> Helping clients deliver on the objectives they've set </h3>

		<p> A goal without a plan is like a bicycle with no wheels, without the right components you'll never get to your intended destination. </p> 
		
		<p>Over the past ten years I've partnered with a diverse book of clients to help them achieve their respective goals. By understanding their needs, leveraging data and various research methods, and assessing the underlying context, I've developed thoughtful, results-driven strategies.  </p>
