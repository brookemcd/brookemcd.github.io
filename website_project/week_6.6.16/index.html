				<!-- <p> Welcome to my website. I'm using this website to capture some of my most meaningful professional experiences to date. Like many other humans, it's challenging to capture all that I've accomplished in a 7 page website. So, instead, I've culled my experiences down into four main areas and highlighted some of my most interesting projects. Short on time? Check out <a href="about_me.html"> About Me.</a> </p>

				<p> I've had the good fortune of working for a variety of businesses - from nonprofits, to small-to-medium businesses, and large corporations - in various capacities. In all roles, I've partnered with my clients in service of their respective goals, primarily in the area of marketing and communication. </p>

				<p> Given the confidential nature of some of the work I've done, you'll need a password to access some areas of the website. </p>	 -->

			<footer> <p> Like what you see? Interested in the work I've done to date? Looking for a partner on your next project?
